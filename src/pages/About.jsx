        About the Mason Bee Club
      </h1>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Hi! I’m Eric — and this whole project started with a small box of mason
        bees. A friend gave me a bee fostering kit one spring. I set it up outside,
        watched over it, and waited excitedly for the tubes to fill…
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        But they never did.
        At first I thought nothing had happened — until I noticed something subtle:
        the cocoons *had* hatched. The bees *did* emerge. They just flew off and
        lived their own little adventures somewhere nearby.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        That fascinated me. I’ve always loved watching wildlife — especially birds —
        and after seeing how tools like <strong>Birdfy</strong> let people observe and
        learn from nature in real time, a thought clicked into place:
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-green-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-6">
        “What if we could do the same thing for mason bees? What if every bee box
        could tell its own story?”
      </blockquote>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        So the Mason Bee Club was born — a connected network of bee stations with
        optional cameras and sensors, all sending simple activity data to a shared
        website where anyone can watch, learn, and enjoy the tiny miracles happening
        inside these boxes.

        The Vision
      </h2>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-lg">
        <li>A community of backyard bee stations, each contributing data</li>
        <li>Live camera streams or photos for bee tenders who want to share</li>
        <li>Activity charts, hatching info, and environmental insights</li>
        <li>A place for new bee stewards to learn and participate</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-green-700 mt-10 mb-4">
        Why This Matters
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Mason bees are gentle, incredibly efficient pollinators. They’re easy to
        raise, fun to watch, and genuinely helpful to local ecosystems. By connecting
        stations together, we can celebrate these tiny environmental heroes — and
        help them thrive.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg mb-6">
        Whether you're a bee tender with a full station, a curious watcher exploring
        the club, or someone who just loves helping pollinators…
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-3xl font-extrabold text-green-800 text-center mt-8 mb-4">
